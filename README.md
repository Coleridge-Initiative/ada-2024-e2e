# Arkansas ADA 2024 class

The U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s Employment and Training Administration funded a suite of Applied Data Analytics training classes delivered by the Coleridge Initiative, in partnership with the state of Arkansas and the National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA). The training classes focused on the cross-section of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs and services linked to employment and wage outcomes. Accepted class participants learned and applied data analytic approaches to linked Arkansas SNAP, TANF, WIOA, and Unemployment Insurance (UI) employment and wage data to better understand the impacts of these programs on individuals, families, and communities.
